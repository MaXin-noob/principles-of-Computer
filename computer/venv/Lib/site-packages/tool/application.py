Application
===========

This is the core of Tool. You can safely ignore it and use other parts of the
package, but in most cases you will really need the power of
:class:`ApplicationManager`. It's also a good idea to subscribe to signals that
it emits.

        dictionary or path to a YAML file from which the dictionary can be

        Still, this doesn't matter if you are not going to use the
        :class:`Application` API after wrapping it in middleware.

        Another option::

            app.wsgi_app = DebuggedApplication(app.wsgi_app)

        This is much better as it doesn't hide away the API. However, it does
        break middleware introspection (see :doc:`debug`) so use with care.
