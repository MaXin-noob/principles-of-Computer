HTTP Serving
============

:state: stable
:dependencies: Werkzeug_
:feature: `http`

This extension handles everything related to serving a web application. It does
not however include the application itself (middleware, routing, etc.).

.. _Werkzeug: http://werkzeug.pocoo.org

    autoreloader), that variable gets lost. So we explicitly inform this very
    command about the application.
